## Game Overview

### Objective
The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. A natural Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) pays immediately.

### Starting the Game
1. **Welcome Screen**: The game begins with a welcome banner and a brief overview of the rules.
2. **Player Setup**: Enter the number of players and place your bets. Each player must bet an amount within the table's minimum and maximum limits.
3. **Initial Deal**: Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards. One of the dealer's cards remains hidden.

### Player Turn
- Each player takes turns to play.
- On your turn, you can:
  - **Hit**: Draw another card.
  - **Stand**: Keep your current hand.
  - **Double Down**: Double your bet and draw one final card.

### Dealer Turn
- The dealer reveals their hidden card and plays according to the rules:
  - Hit on 16 or less.
  - Stand on 17 or higher.

### End of Game
- The game ends when all players and the dealer have completed their turns.
- The winner is determined based on the scores:
  - Closest to 21 without exceeding it.
  - If all players bust, the dealer wins.
